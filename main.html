			Viraj is a Mumbai-based fashion photographer whose life revolves around his six-year-old daughter Mahi, who is battling cystic fibrosis.
 They live with the latter's grandfather. Mahi, who has no idea who her mother is, demands her father to narrate her mother's story. 
When Viraj promises to do so but doesn't, a furious Mahi runs away from home with their pet dog Pluto and crosses paths with Yashna, who saves her from a traffic collision. 
Befriending Yashna, Mahi recruits her assistance to convince Viraj to tell her about her mother; together, they compel Viraj to recount the story of his wife and going by Yashna's advice, Mahi imagines her to be her biological mother Varsha.

Viraj and Varsha happened to cross paths in Coonoor and Viraj falls in love at first sight; however, Varsha does not believe in love or marriage due to her traumatic experience with her parents' failed marriage and initially insists that they remain friends. 
However, she eventually falls in love with him. Varsha's mother disapproves of their relationship, citing Viraj's inferior financial status, but Varsha leaves everyone in Viraj's favour and marries him.
 After three years of blissful marital life, Viraj divulges his intention of having kids, and although initially reluctant, Varsha agrees to conceive after Viraj promises her that it will be the best decision of their life. 
However Mahi's birth reveals her fatal health condition, leading to further tensions. A dispirited Varsha blames Viraj and regrets conceiving Mahi. At this point, a tearful Mahi restrains Viraj from narrating the story further. 
Later, on Yashna's insistence, Viraj discloses to Yashna that he and Varsha had met with an accident that night.

Yashna is revealed to be Mahi's mother and Viraj's wife, who was inflicted with Post-traumatic amnesia after her accident; 
Yashna's mother had pleaded Viraj to stay away from Varsha, told them that Varsha had asked for a divorce from Viraj before the accident.
 Viraj had recounted the tale with some changes (changing her name to Varsha and changing her sister to a brother) to prevent Yashna from realizing that she was the woman in the story.

Yashna is about to get married to Dr. Aravind in a few weeks. Yashna and Mahi's bond strengthens, worrying Viraj, who instantaneously departs to
 Goa under pretext of a project with Mahi, planning to stay there until Yashna gets married - however, Yashna manages to get there in time to surprise Mahi with a birthday party when Viraj had forgotten about it. 
Viraj and Yashna grow closer, and Viraj, Yashna, Mahi and Pluto share a special moment. The next day, Yashna proposes to Viraj but he minds the promise he had made to Yashna's mother and dismisses her proposal. 
Aravind schedules their wedding in Goa and a heartbroken Yashna proceeds with her planned wedding. Mahi sneaks away, again, to visit Yashna before her marriage. Yashna's mother finds her and tells her the truth, shattering Mahi. 
Mahi later has a respiratory failure and is immediately admitted into a hospital.

Mahi's grandfather, who is revealed to be Yashna's father, shows up at Yashna's wedding and advises her to fight for her love and notifies her of Mahi's condition. 
Though she doesn't remember the past, Yashna reveals that she had never asked for a divorce - upon hearing this, Aravind gives Yashna his consent, while also coming to know that Yashna's mother lied about "Varsha" asking for a divorce from Viraj. 
Yashna deserts her wedding and immediately rushes to the hospital, restoring her relationship with Viraj. Aravind, his brother and his friends, who turn out to be renowned doctors, volunteer to perform the operation that has a supposed 0.1% probability and save Mahi. 
As Viraj's hope reignites, Yashna, contradictory what she had wished for before her accident, wishes that she had conceived Mahi instead of "Varsha". As Mahi survives, the film ends with her grown self singing a song taught by Yashna on stage.
